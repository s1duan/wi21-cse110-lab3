## Standup Notes

### 01-20-2021
- What I did yesterday: set up the new repo for lab 3 and cloned lab 2 codes into the new repo
- What I will do today: create custom issue labels and templates, getting started on adding css to my personal website
- Where I am blocked: not applicable
- Comfort level: still have a lot of coding to do to complete the lab
